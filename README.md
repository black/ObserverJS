# Observer JS

### Kotlin inspired viewmodel like class for JavaScript.  

This library allows you to observe data changes and update views. The design and application is inspired by the Kotlin way of implementing the ViewModel class where you set a value and observe changes at one or more places to update the view. 

_I am still working on it so use this on your own risk._
